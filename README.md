# YouTube Channel Network Platform

A quantum-inspired, event-driven platform for orchestrating YouTube content creation, collaboration, and automation at scale.

## Key Features
- **Channel-centric business network**: Channels are the atomic business unit, supporting collaboration, cross-promotion, and resource sharing.
- **Unified user/agent model**: Humans and AI agents are both users with dynamic, channel-specific roles.
- **Event-driven orchestration**: All business logic and workflows are triggered by events, enabling modularity, scalability, and resilience.
- **Marketplace-ready**: Channels can hire human or AI agents for any task, and talent can be dynamically assigned across the network.
- **Analytics-driven**: Every action is logged and used to optimize workflows, assignments, and business outcomes.

## Folder Structure
- `backend/` — FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, event bus, modular services, analytics
- `frontend/` — React/TypeScript, channel dashboard, workflow, user/agent management, analytics
- `scripts/` — DB init, seed, event simulation
- `docs/` — Architecture, API, business network, lessons learned
- `tests/` — Backend and frontend tests

## Getting Started
1. See `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design and `/docs/BUSINESS_NETWORK.md` for business logic.
2. Run backend and frontend with provided scripts.
3. Use the event simulator to test orchestration and workflows.

## Vision
This platform is engineered for business velocity, technical excellence, and future-proof growth in the YouTube content ecosystem.
